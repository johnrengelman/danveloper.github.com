<div class="paragraph">
<p>The past week I was privileged to attend the SpringOne 2GX conference in beautiful Santa Clara, CA. This year&#8217;s version of the popular conference was regarded as the most attended for any years' past. By my assessment, there must have been between 1,000 and 1,200 people there. There were a possible of 9 concurrent sessions across a total of 13 time blocks between the three days of the conference. That meant that there was a potential of 117 sessions from which to choose; a daunting task, to say the least.</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_location">The Location</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The conference was hosted at the Santa Clara Conference Center (SCCC), which was attached to the Santa Clara Hyatt, where the speakers and many of the conference attendees were lodged. The hotel was beautiful, and it had a very nice lounge/bar area off the lobby. The rooms were nice too, although the 10th floor (where I stayed) had probably seen better days.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The hotel was equipped with a very nice pool and an adjacent jacuzzi. I was happy with how clean both of them were, and made it a point to go for a swim the moment that I arrived. The California heat was no match for the chilly blue water, and I could only stay in for a few minutes before having to get out and warm back up in the sunshine. The jacuzzi was a welcome relief in this case.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I didn&#8217;t get as much time to swim and play as I would&#8217;ve liked, but on the last night of the conference, <a href="http://twitter.com/colinharrington">Colin Harrington</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/smaldini">Stephane Maldini</a>, and myself spent some time in the jacuzzi and the pool. There were reports that the pool had closed by the time we started swimming, but then that couldn&#8217;t have been true, because we were in the pool, and it was wide open, not closed. There were also reports of a suspected high-level of adult beverage consumption, but more on that later&#8230;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The biggest downside to the location was that there was literally nothing worthwhile in the area. This hotel and conference center is located in a tiny bubble of Silicon Valley that didn&#8217;t see the need to put in gas stations, grocery stores, or restaurants. I was a little disappointed in this, because part of the reason that it was so cool to go to Silicon Valley was to see the area and experience the vibe. Most everybody that I talked to during the conference were also disappointed by this. As a saving grace, there was a light rail nearby that a few of the other conference-goers took to travel into San Francisco. The bar tender at the Hyatt bar told me that it also goes into downtown San Jose and Mountain View.</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_a_little_vacation">A Little Vacation</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I didn&#8217;t want to miss out on any sight-seeing while I was there, so I went ahead and rented a car. My wife had flown in on Monday, and we made a fun little mini-vacation out of the trip by visiting Google headquarters, and having lunch a little cafe that overlooked a nearby Mountain View lake. We also drove through Cupertino and marveled at the houses that we drove by, while we investigated their prices on Zillow. Much to my wife&#8217;s relief, they were all well outside of our budget :-).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the conference, we drove a little south and headed due west toward the coast. We had never seen the Pacific coastline, and it was really cool to just be able to pull off the road and end up at an incredible little private beach on the side of the road. We had intentionally gone a little south to start with so that we could have a longer drive along the scenic route, as we headed toward San Francisco.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We got to San Francisco in the early afternoon and had a chance to go over the Golden Gate Bridge (a first for me). At the end of the bridge, there&#8217;s a little turn off where you can go out and see the bay in its full glory. We spent a few minutes reveling in the beauty of the scenery before getting back on the road and traveling a little north of San Francisco, where we were destined for <a href="http://www.nps.gov/muwo/index.htm">Muir Woods National Monument</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Muir Woods is a sanctuary for the Redwood trees of the area, and is truly an awe-inspiring visit. Some of the Redwoods tower hundreds of feet in the air, and are wide enough at the trunk for you and a few friends to hang out in. More impressive than the trees is that this area&#8217;s natural beauty was able to be preserved in such close proximity to the dense population centers of San Francisco and surrounding cities. The trip is less than ten minutes outside of San Francisco, and looking at a map you wouldn&#8217;t understand how it&#8217;s possible that such a thing can exist so close to the big city. To get there means carefully navigating a maze and network of windy roads and steep hills that eventually dump you into a valley that is very clearly a self-sufficient ecosystem; it is truly a different world up there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thursday night, we used the <a href="http://www.hoteltonight.com/">Hotels Tonight</a> app to secure a room at the Hilton in downtown San Francisco. We were worn out from such a long day, so after a nice Italian dinner, we boarded up until the morning. We were (amazingly) able to find street parking right in front of the hotel, but it meant that I had to get up at 7am to put money on the meter. Luckily the city of San Francisco exists in the future, where I live, and has a mobile website for adding time to your parking. It wasn&#8217;t until later that I found out that I had misread the location code on the meter, and I had been paying for the guy&#8217;s parking behind me, but it didn&#8217;t really matter since I didn&#8217;t get a ticket. It also meant that when our time ran out, we were able to renew it without having to move the car. Typically you are only permitted to park in a spot for four hours, so my screw-up meant that we could park there for an addition four without getting in trouble.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Through the day on Friday, we walked up and down the wharf and went into all of the little shops that peddle their trinkets and over-priced tee-shirts. We went down to Pier 39 and had lunch overlooking the bay. I worked on solidifying some plans for our very fluid vacation, and secured us a two-night stay at a Holiday Inn right next to the San Jose airport. It was perfect because it was close-by to where we had to return our rental car (not the airport, they were out of cars), and less than a mile from the airport itself. To boot, I used Priceline and got the room for an amazing $60 per night! When we got there, we were literally given a suite, and I have nothing but excellent things to say about the accommodations at that hotel, including its High Speed Internet, which actually worked at high speeds, unlike most hotels. The Hilton didn&#8217;t even offer complimentary internet, so it was a welcome relief to have anything, let alone blazing fast speeds!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After we returned our car on Saturday, we took the light rail into downtown San Jose and walked around a little bit. There wasn&#8217;t really much to do there, so we just stopped and had some local beers from a cliche British pub on the main drag. After that, we went back to the hotel and crashed for a few hours. Before we had dropped off the car, we had managed to pick up a few bottles of California red wine, so we ordered-in a pizza, and had a cost-effective evening.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our flight left on Sunday morning at 6:40a, so we took the 5:00a shuttle to the airport. Since I was a speaker at the conference, they had booked my ticket, which meant that my wife and I weren&#8217;t sitting next to each other on the plane. When we got to the airport, I asked the representative at the Delta desk if our seats could be moved next to each other. Her words exactly were, "I&#8217;ll call your name if we can accommodate you"; suffice it to say, I wasn&#8217;t hopeful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To my surprise, she <strong>did</strong> call my name, and she <strong>was</strong> able to move us next to each other, and she was very nice and pleasant in doing so. Even better than that, she got us into the emergency exit row, which meant that we had enough foot room to stretch out and take some much-needed naps on the three-hour plane ride back home. My wife was continuing on to another flight to go to my sister-in-law&#8217;s, who had watched our daughter for the week, and the flight attendant let her move to the front of the plane so that she could catch her connection on time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All-in-all, we had a really great mini-vacation.</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_keynotes">The Keynotes</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The opening night&#8217;s keynote started out with an introduction from Pivotal PR Rockstar, Pieter Humphrey, who brought to the stage Pivotal CEO, Paul Maritz. Maritz was an inspiring keynote introduction, and offered his considerable experiences with software development to express his intuition that we&#8217;re at a pivot point (pun intended) in software development, where things are changing rapidly and drastically. He talked a lot about cloud computing, and made the assertion that cloud is "not the new mainframe, it should be something developers can use freely". The vibe for cloud computing, and its importance for the Spring ecosystem of products, had already been staged by the two-day "Platform" pre-conference that focused on Cloud Foundry awesomeness. Even though they were giving away food and booze and hoodies and shit, I didn&#8217;t attend; it seemed a little too sales-pitchy for my taste, but there was probably some worthwhile technical discussions about cloud in there too. Overall, I think it was important for Pivotal to set the precedence that they&#8217;re a premiere player in the cloud-computing vertical, and that was a heavily propagated concept throughout the conference. Indeed, during the conference they announced the Cloud Foundry partnership with IBM, something that <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/08/ibm-backs-cf">I&#8217;d written about</a> just prior to the conference.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Adrian Colyer followed Maritz in the opening night&#8217;s keynote, and unveiled some impressive alterations to Spring framework&#8217;s org chart. "Spring IO", Colyer started, "will now be the name representing the Spring platform as a whole". "Spring IO Foundation" is now the name used to represent the component modules of the soon-to-be-released version 4 of the Spring framework.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was happy for <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org">Groovy</a> to be now officially supported as a core component of the framework. It lends a lot of credibility to the language, and shows that there will be continued support for it in the long-run.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Colyer went further in defining the layers of Spring IO, offering a new term, "Domain Specific Runtime", to describe the areas in which the runtime-environments that build on Spring will be situated in the structure. This DSR layer of Spring IO is known as the "IO Execution" layer, and is where <a href="http://grails.org">Grails</a>, <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring Boot</a>, and <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-xd/">Spring XD</a> all fall. The restructuring makes sense, and I think helps to visualize how the different parts all work interchangeably.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, Colyer put an end to a long-felt, arduous sentiment of Spring, by clearly and definitively declaring that "XML is not the world of Spring," noting that future releases of the framework will focus heavily on annotations to drive behavior. And with that, Colyer invited <a href="http://twitter.com/david_syer">David Syer</a> to the stage to introduce <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring Boot</a>, a project reference that polluted my Twitter feed in the days leading up to the conference.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In under sixty seconds, Syer demonstrated how to take a simple Groovy class, declare the class-level <code>@Controller</code> annotation, and with Spring Boot turn it in to a web application. I have to admit that I was astonished at the simplicity. He then went on to spend about ten minutes demonstrating the same capabilities in Java. I couldn&#8217;t tell if that was carefully crafted demo-fu to ensure the audience understood the importance of Groovy in the upcoming releases of Spring, or if it actually was that difficult to get off the ground with the Java version of the live-coding demo. Either way, Spring Boot was disruptive to the audience and is <strong>definitely</strong> something that I&#8217;ll be looking into in the coming months.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Juergen Hoeller followed on stage and talked about some of the new awesomeness coming in Spring 4. He discussed at a conceptual level some of the refined injection support, and he talked about the Websocket support in the upcoming version of Spring. Spring 4 will also support the <a href="http://stomp.github.io/">STOMP</a> Websocket sub-protocol, and will provide seamless fall back to <a href="http://sockjs.org">SockJS</a> for older browsers. Hoeller also revealed that Spring 4 will drop support for Java 5, and noted that with "Spring 4, [they] are raising the bar."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What followed was the most impressive part of the first night keynote, and that was <a href="http://twitter.com/cbeams">Chris Beams</a> getting on stage and revealing the new website for the Spring framework. I have to admit that when I heard they were releasing a new website, I didn&#8217;t really care. From a marketing perspective, it seemed appropriate to have this be a part of the opening night keynote, but it wasn&#8217;t until I actually saw Beams do a live <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html">blue-green deployment</a> of the website that I was truly impressed. It was noted that the new <a href="http://spring.io">Spring IO website</a> would be a community reference project for Spring Boot, and could be contributed back-to by the open source community. What seemed most notable was the very clear separation from previous-parent, VMware. The new Spring IO site takes on its own design and there are no lingering references to VMware or VMware&#8217;s parent company, EMC, anywhere. It is now very clear that Pivotal is its own distinct business entity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perhaps more notable than the live release of the site is its new design and content. The Pivotal development team must have put strenuous months of work into developing the <a href="https://spring.io/guides">Guides</a> section of the site, that offers cookbook recipes to get you up and running for a variety of eventualities. This level of documentation is what will be the most useful thing for me, and will certainly drive a higher adoption rate for newcomers to the framework.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second night&#8217;s keynote started out by celebrating the 10th birthday of the Groovy programming language. After that, <a href="http://grails.io">Graeme Rocher</a> announced the Grails 2.3 GA release, which was very well received by the audience. Though the release had actually been the day prior, and was well anticipated by those of us who follow the mailing list, it was energizing to hear 1,000+ people applauding this milestone for the framework.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rocher went on to live code in SublimeText (like a boss), demonstrating the new REST features offered by Grails 2.3. In a very short period of time, he wrote a domain class and exposed it as a "resource", which built the URL mappings for the REST endpoints. From there, he demonstrated how to interrogate those endpoints for CRUD operations. In another audience-wide applause, Rocher announced the first milestone release of the <a href="http://grails.org/plugins/gorm-rest-client">GORM Rest Client plugin</a>, which allows you to map domain classes and use GORM operations against a remote endpoint. While live coding, he demonstrated building a client application that mapped a <code>Book</code> domain class to a partner application, which had its <code>Book</code> domain class exposed a resource. Using standard GORM methods, he was able to query the domain class from the remote entity through that layer of RESTful abstraction, which adds a lot of flexibility to the persistence model. Rocher also live-demonstrated how the new Async APIs can be leveraged with GORM to perform a concurrent retrieval of data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally announced features of Grails 2.3 GA included:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

<ul>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Following Rocher, <a href="http://twitter.com/michaelminella">Michael Minella</a> got on stage to talk about Spring Batch. Minella is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pro-Spring-Batch-Michael-Minella/dp/1430234520">Pro Spring Batch</a>, and is very much a leading expert on the subject. Batch is a hot topic that has gained a lot of traction over the past few years, and there&#8217;s no mistaking that Spring Batch laid the foundation groundwork for the JSR-352 specification in the recent Java EE 7 release&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a fact that is well voiced by the Pivotal/Spring PR machines. Minella demonstrated how the JSR-352 specification borrowed the Spring Batch documentation nearly verbatim. He additionally noted that Spring Batch developers comprised 25% of the JSR-352 expert group. Minella is passionate about what he does, which is admirable and makes me really enjoy watching him present, but I have to admit that I think that batch is a somewhat dry topic. Even after studying batch processing for weeks leading up to an <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/06/ee7-spring-batch">article that I wrote for InfoQ</a>, I still find it a tough subject to get excited about. Minella does get excited about it though, and that brings a level of excitement and energy to an otherwise bland subject matter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After Minella, <a href="http://twitter.com/m_f_">Mark Fisher</a> took to the stage to talk about big data and one of the Domain Specific Runtimes, <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-xd/">Spring XD</a>. In a live coding session, he reworked a demo from last year&#8217;s SpringOne to show the audience how Spring XD makes batch processing and enterprise integration a simple command-line thing. The demo was designed to follow the Twitter popularity of presidential candidates during the 2012 election season, using Justin Bieber mentions as the control variable. He demoed the Spring XD shell, and showed how quickly you can build nodes and create streams to do processing. I&#8217;ll admit that for most of his demo, I couldn&#8217;t see what he was typing, so it was a bit tough to follow exactly what he was doing, but I got the point. I was <strong>really</strong> impressed when he demonstrated how Spring XD let&#8217;s you leverage Spring Integration&#8217;s concept of channel adapters to tie into big data processing. In the second part of his demo, the example again hooked up to Twitter, this time to analyze hashtag popularity and show the aggregate data on a web-page in real-time. Spring XD is another thing that I will spend some time familiarizing myself with, because it seems like it can simplify a lot of the scariness of "big data" processing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fisher noted that by 2020, more than 42% of all data on the internet will be generated by machines, and the Spring XD project was doing work to simplify the interpolation of that data. A commendable goal that has inspired me to dig deeper into the project and see how I can use to simplify my applications.</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_sessions">The Sessions</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I started out the conference by attending the first of a two-part presentation by <a href="http://twitter.com/nebhale">Ben Hale</a> entitled <em>"REST-ful API Design"</em>. This was a session that was on the <em>SpringOne</em> side of things, not the <em>2GX</em>, but since I still do a lot of coding with Spring-proper, I felt it was an appropriate session to go visit. Given the title and my perceived understanding of API design, I wasn&#8217;t sure how much I would get out of it, but I decided to give it a go anyway.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had never before seen a presentation by Hale, but I can now say that he is hands down one of the best public speakers and presenters that I&#8217;ve seen in the tech world. I hadn&#8217;t thought about some of the minor nuances of designing a REST API, so a lot of the stuff that he said was thought provoking, and stuff that I&#8217;ll consider in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<div class="title">Some of the highlights were:</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>REST is more what you would call <em>guidelines</em> than actual rules;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REST URIs should describe only nouns;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HTTP verbs describe operations in REST;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GET requests shouldn&#8217;t have any <strong>major</strong> changes to the operation of the system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DELETE requests do not need to be completed immediately, can be a long running task;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>POST requests is where you get to do all the business logic that you think doesn&#8217;t fit into the four HTTP verbs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>POST is a "catch-all bucket" when the other verbs don&#8217;t apply;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PUT payload <strong>should</strong> be a complete entity, but it&#8217;s not strictly required;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There&#8217;s an official <em>Location</em> header that you should use for 201 responses (Entity Created);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Spring there&#8217;s an <code>@ExceptionHandler</code> annotation so that you don&#8217;t return an HTML error page for REST clients;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hale pronounces HATEOAS as "HATE-OHs", tends to think of it as "Cheerios, only angry";</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this, Hale noted that some responses, POST requests for example, don&#8217;t always require a response body. This is not something that I had really thought of, and makes perfect sense when figuring a "standard" way to develop an API. Hale also touched on the growing popularity of the PATCH verb for updating an entity, but stated that although PUT requests <strong>should</strong> be complete entities, it is not strictly required, so your implementation can vary depending on how you want to treat the functionality of PUT.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Somebody asked the question about using a WADL to define your REST contract, which is something that I&#8217;ve thought was a good idea in the past. Hale responded by stating that thorough documentation is greater than any WADL will ever be, a fact for which I deeply agree.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He then demonstrated the HATEOAS support offered in Spring 4, which was really impressive. In just a few lines of code, the API was able to provide links and ref&#8217;s in the REST response. Hale explained that HATEOAS is important for API consumers to be able to extract endpoint navigation from the response. That way, the consumer application doesn&#8217;t need to strictly know what the endpoints are, as they can be derived from the links embedded in the response.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second session that I went to was presented by <a href="http://twitter.com/ghillert">Gunnar Hillert</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/michaelminella">Michael Minella</a>. Entitled, "Integrating Spring Batch and Spring Integration", I was very excited to learn the ways in which the two projects had cross-pollinated, and to see how they had built the foundation for Spring XD. Since so much of my development over the past couple of years has been centered on working with Spring Integration and building message-driven applications, I could kind of already imagine how the two projects could be coupled together, but I wanted to see it in person.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I could tell that the intention was to present the two topics along discrete paths, and then bring the whole talk together by demonstrating their interoperability, but the demos were kind of hard to follow, so that made it tough to grasp what was going on. Also, no fault to the speakers, it was a very difficult audience. There was one guy in the audience who asked a question for a good ten minutes, and when Minella asked him to defer the question until after the demos, the guy just kept going and going. There were others in the audience who had clearly worked with Spring Batch before and were asking very targeted questions that didn&#8217;t pertain to the material that was being presented (Spring Admin, for example, which I had never heard of), so that context switching made following the presentation difficult. That also left them with only a few minutes for the final demos, so I didn&#8217;t really get to see the interoperability between the two projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Minella and Hillert are two experts in the area of batch and integration respectively, and I really wish that the audience had been a little bit better to them, because their slides were comprehensive and you could tell that they had spent a good amount of time putting the demos together. I&#8217;d like to see this presentation again, without the peanut gallery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was admittedly distracted during this presentation too, since I was very nervous for <strong>my</strong> upcoming talk, which was in the next session slot, slated to immediately follow lunch&#8230; But, more on that later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After my talk, I skipped the next session, then ended the day with a presentation by <a href="http://twitter.com/j_brisbin">Jon Brisbin</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/smaldini">Stephane Maldini</a> about <a href="https://github.com/reactor/reactor">Project Reactor</a>. There&#8217;s a ton of information already available about Project Reactor, but I think the most succinct statement that Brisbin made to describe the project was "Reactor is a distillation of other libraries and best-practices." To put that more clearly, they took all the good stuff from other projects and libraries that they had used to build an asynchronous application foundation, and boiled them down into a single project that didn&#8217;t have any of the auxiliary crap that goes along with using those dependencies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Brisbin also made it clear that "Reactor isn&#8217;t competing with other frameworks". As a component of the <em>core</em> module in the <em>IO Foundation</em> layer of the Spring framework, its goal is wholly to facilitate rapid data transference, and to do that, they built Reactor on an asynchronous runtime model. Much of the talk was really geared toward how to use that runtime model, and how the patterns that they&#8217;ve built leverage familiarities from popular libraries and frameworks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, in a Reactor application, some data can be transmitted to a variety of async tasks, and those async tasks can be configured to consume data based on route events. These route events are configured using jQuery-like selector syntax, that can subscribe a class or closure to an event in a similar way that <em>routing topics</em> work with messages. There&#8217;s also sequencer support for event ordering that allows for composition of objects throughout an asynchronous workflow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Brisbin described how much of the interfaces in Reactor followed Java 8 patterns, and would be well suited for drop-in replacements when Java 8 is finished. The interfaces they designed for Reactor are <code>Consumer</code>, <code>Supplier</code>, <code>Function</code>, and <code>Predicate</code>. Reactor also adopted the concept of a <code>Promise</code> and there is a fully-featured Stream API for functional programming.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reactor also supports TCP Client/Server programming with <a href="http://netty.io">Netty</a> under the hood. But, perhaps the most impressive and overall cool thing about Project Reactor is that although it falls in the <em>core</em> module of Spring, it <strong>does not require Spring</strong>. This means that you can build applications that are <em>just</em> based on Reactor, without the heavy-duty requirements of Spring. That makes Reactor a very appealing foundation for a variety of high-throughput implementations!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On Tuesday evening, after the dinner and keynote, we broke out into birds of a feather sessions. The Groovy/Grails BOF was very well attended, and was moderated by <a href="http://twitter.com/sbglasius">Søren Berg Glasius</a> with the Grails dev team (<a href="http://twitter.com/graemerocher">Graeme Rocher</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/jeffscottbrown">Jeff Scott Brown</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/burtbeckwith">Burt Beckwith</a>), and the Groovy dev team (<a href="http://twitter.com/glaforge">Guillame Laforge</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/CedricChampeau">Cédric Champeau</a>) ready to answer questions at the front of the room. This was perhaps the most engaging BOF session that I&#8217;ve ever seen. It was also nice that although we started without beer, at some point somebody brought in a cart full of beer (Søren maybe?). To whomever was the angel behind that, thank you, really.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We started out the BOF by talking about security, which is a topic that I brought up. After this session, I am now thoroughly convinced that nobody wants a Grails-proper implementation of security. We also went on to talk about Grails adoption rates, and the misunderstanding that since there are not many job postings tagged with Grails that there are no Grails jobs. Just about everybody spoke up to say that, while their company uses Grails heavily, they open jobs for Java developers, stipulating a preference for Spring experience. At one point, somebody in the audience asked about popularity compared to other web frameworks, and it was great to see Graeme respond so passionately.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Graeme&#8217;s points for that question were very well delivered and very well received. He noted that it isn&#8217;t fair to compare Grails to other web frameworks, because there are very few web frameworks that do all of the same things. In most cases, he said, they will handle the view layer and maybe set the stage for adopting an MVC pattern, but Grails is so much more than that. He talked about the data binding and data modeling features of the framework, and how having all the necessary components available integrated is what differentiates Grails. He referred to a recent comparison of Grails and JSF, and sharply noted that they could not be compared on the same level, since they are inherently different things. Graeme rarely jumps outside of his very calm and cool composure, so to see him so visually passionate about this topic added some importance to his words.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Later in the evening, Burt proposed the idea of changing the name of the framework for the 3.0 track. Many people in the audience had made note that Grails had gotten a bad wrap in the early days, and that stigma was still attached to the much more robust and modern versions that are in the wild today. It seemed like the audience had mixed interest in a name change. Indeed, from my own perspective, abandoning the very well-established name for the sake of the uninformed seems a little defeatist. However, I understand how it might help to garner more support from companies who are looking to adopt a full-stack framework and have only heard bad things about Grails from its early days. I&#8217;ll be interested to see how this plays out; it wasn&#8217;t very clear how far down this thought track the core team had gone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We didn&#8217;t do much talking about Groovy during the BOF, and at one point Guillame actually fell asleep while sitting upright. Surely he was exhausted from traveling, and he graciously bowed-out about half of the way through the session. I wish we&#8217;d had more Groovy stuff to talk about, but with Grails 2.3 having just been released, and much discussion of Grails 3.0 at the conference, it was bound to be a Grails-centric conversation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Groovy/Grails BOF session ran longer than any of the other BOFs, which I consider a true testament to the engagement of the community. I didn&#8217;t see anybody in the room who was afraid to ask questions or present ideas. People were even nice enough to entertain my thoughts on security. We ran over time by nearly double the allotted period, and at the end of it, some of us gathered by the bar for drinks and conversation. T&#8217;was indeed an excellent session.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next day I was due to speak again, so I had much anxiety about that, but I started out the morning by live-tweeting through <a href="http://twitter.com/pledbrook">Peter Ledbrook&#8217;s</a> talk on <em>"Application Architectures with Grails"</em>. I felt it appropriate to attend this one, since my talk later that afternoon was entitled <em>"Application Architecture in Groovy"</em>, and quite frankly I wouldn&#8217;t miss an opportunity to see a <em>"pledbrook presentation"</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Peter is a fantastic and thoughtful technical presenter and a highly skilled public speaker. Listening to him talk open source and software development is always an enlightening experience. During his talk, Peter discussed how to structure Grails applications to adopt the CQRS model, and he posed thought-provoking questions like, "Why do we always start modeling our applications at the database?". Peter&#8217;s assertion is that our persistence model isn&#8217;t our domain model, so we need to stop treating it like it his. He recommended using command objects to help bridge the gap between the two concepts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As he went on, Peter talked about how to build messaging into Grails, and how adopting messaging concepts can lead to a flexible implementations, but he cautiously warned that they&#8217;re hard to debug. He discussed how to build messaging layers using Spring Integration, and even gave a shout-out to my prior-day&#8217;s talk on that exact subject!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Peter continued by exploring the use of the <a href="http://grails.org/plugins/grails-events">grails-events</a> plugin to build an event-driven architecture that can work with a similar fluidity as messaging. He also proposed the idea that we don&#8217;t even need plugins in Grails to accomplish an event-driven architecture, because we have the Spring <code>ApplicationContext</code>, which has a full-featured, built-in event bus.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I like to hear Peter speak because he talks at a very conceptual level. From a personal standpoint, I really like for speakers to convey their mindset, and how their mode of thinking is a problem-solving approach. Although beneficial to demonstrate concepts with code examples and demonstrations, when talking architecture patterns or programming styles, I think it&#8217;s of overarching importance to understand the internal questions that lead to adopting a particular style or philosophy. Peter&#8217;s in-depth understanding of application development and open source put him in an excellent position to convey his mindset in a practical way for his audience.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="_my_talks">My Talks</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had to present my first talk on the first <em>real</em> day of SpringOne 2GX, and that made me extremely nervous. This was a talk that I had not given in any real capacity thus far (outside of presenting to a group of uninterested developers at my last job), so I was very anxious when putting together presentation material for a 90 minute session. I had no basis for how much material would fit into 90 minutes, so it was difficult to know whether I would come up short or run too long; indeed, I was more concerned for the former. Given that, I spent a lot of time and exhaustive effort putting together slides and material for the first talk, <em>"Message Driven Architecture in Grails"</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Building a message-driven architecture has a lot to do with approaching the matter of application architecture from a different perspective and mindset. I felt that it was as important to convey that as it was to actually demonstrate the code. To that end, I had tweaked the slides carefully to allow an introductory period to introduce the mindset and thought-approach for what I would be demonstrating. Unfortunately, I kind of missed the mark on how much time I would spend talking during the "introductory" portion of the talk, and that meant that the demo had to be cut incredibly short.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was very disappointed that I didn&#8217;t get to do more live-coding, but I felt that the combination of the introductory conversation and the code that I <em>did</em> have time to demonstrate was suitable exposure for the audience to get them off the ground in their own applications. The feedback that I received was mixed. Some people really liked the discussion of the mindset that goes into architecting these applications, while some people just wanted to see code. My pacing was way off, primarily because I didn&#8217;t know what to expect, and that was a fact that was clearly pointed out to me afterwards. With some refining, the next time that I give this talk it will be more balanced.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next day I gave my second talk, the one for which I had delivered a variation of at <a href="http://gr8conf.us">Gr8Conf US</a> in July, <em>"Application Architecture in Groovy"</em>. After presenting the talk in July, I was able to fine-tune it based off of the wonderful feedback that I got from the other, more-experienced speakers and conference goers. That basically involved me tearing it down and starting from complete scratch, but I feel like I nailed it at SpringOne.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I wasn&#8217;t as nervous about fitting this talk into 90 minutes as I was the first talk, because when I gave it at Gr8Conf, I had overrun the hour slot and had to race through the rest of my material. At SpringOne, the conversation was much more fluid, and I felt that I balanced the time on the demos with the time on the discussion well. I didn&#8217;t get much feedback from this talk, and I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s a good thing or a bad thing, but most of the people who I would expect to give me candid feedback had decided on other sessions, like a bunch of jerks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Truth be told, I was nervous about having enough attendees for either presentation. During my first talk, I was competing with Graeme Rocher&#8217;s talk, <em>"Road to Grails 3.0"</em>, for which I figured everybody on the 2GX side would be going. I was pleasantly surprised to have a full audience in attendance for my talk. The second talk was not as well visited, but I did notice <a href="http://twitter.com/glaforge">Guillame Laforge</a> at the back of the room, and I was pleased that some of my discussions and demos caused him to lift his head from his laptop in a "that&#8217;s interesting" kind of way. Towards the end of my second talk, it seemed like the other talks had finished up early because within the last 15 minutes or so, people were spilling out of the room.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Overall, I was very happy with the way that my second talk went, but still feel somewhat neutral on my first talk. It was such a great experience to be a speaker at such an importance conference, and some of the follow-up conversations that I had about architecture and messaging were stimulating and thought-provoking. I wouldn&#8217;t trade all of the hard work that I had to do to make it happen, because it was totally rewarding at the end.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_some_thoughts_on_speaking">Some Thoughts on Speaking</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Speaking at a conference is really, really hard. Let me clarify, the actual speaking part is not hard, people are actually pretty nice and understanding of sub-optimal presentation skills. Rather, it&#8217;s the months and months of night and weekend preparation that lead up to speaking at a conference that are the really, really hard parts. Peter Ledbrook described it to me as "physically exhausting", and I think that about sums it up.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s really draining to work to put together and organize material in a thoughtful kind of way so that your presentation will be pertinent to the majority of the audience. By the time the conference arrived, I knew and felt that I was so over-extended and exhausted, that I was just going to be happy once it was over. Truly, once I had finished giving my talks, I breathed a strong sigh of relief, and was just happy to get to spend time with the great people around me, without having the lingering anxiety of needing to do more work on presentation material.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trade off is that now that I&#8217;ve taken the time and dedicated myself to putting that work in, I know that I have a better understanding of the topics than when I started. I know that organizing my thoughts and being critical and analytical of my own behaviors has given me an insight into how I have written software, and will forever effect how I write software in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even more than that, being passionate about these things&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which, everybody who knows me knows that I am&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;means that they are very important to me, and I want to share my insights with the rest of the world, and get feedback from other people on them. I want to grow and evolve how I work and think, and I want to help others to grow and evolve in the same way, so for that, all of the late nights and tireless work that went into presenting at these conferences this summer has the ultimate payout of self satisfaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On top of that, I&#8217;ve gotten to make a ton of new friends and meet some incredibly smart, fun, and interesting people. And when I boil all of this down and distill it into a single shot, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m left with; at the end of the day, this is all about the people.</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_people">The People</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For me, the biggest takeaway from SpringOne was getting to meet with and talk to all of the incredibly thoughtful and smart people who were there. It&#8217;s amazing how you can talk to these people every day on Twitter, and know their whole life and never have met them before. But then once you do meet them, it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re old friends.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I finally got to meet Grails Champion and Twitter celebrity, Tomas Lin, in real life. He&#8217;s such a cool guy and we had so much fun bullshitting with each other and hanging out every day of the conference. He&#8217;s so incredibly smart and sharp-witted. At the beginning of the conference, he spent time talking to me about testing strategies in Grails with the remote control plugin, and it was stuff that I had never even thought of before. He is also incredibly social and a great link to getting to meet other people.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tomas introduced me to Grails Champion and GrailsMx founder, <a href="http://twitter.com/neodevelop">Juan Reyes</a>, who came from Mexico to attend the conference. Juan and I quickly became friends, and I really enjoyed talking coding with him. He has some excellent insights into software development, and he is a major asset to, and thought leader in, the Grails community. He also runs <a href="http://grails.org.mx">grails.org.mx</a> and organizes a podcast on all-things-groovy. On top of all of that, he is just such an incredibly nice dude, and is impossible to not get along with; I hope that I get to hang out with him more in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I finally got to catch up with Bobby Warner after months of being too busy to even breathe. Bobby and I both live in Minneapolis, but for the past few months, our schedules never aligned. Bobby has such an amazing capacity for understanding and articulating full-stack architecture, that it&#8217;s always enlightening to get to talk to him. He&#8217;s taken that comprehensive vision and started a company out of it, and there&#8217;s no chance that he won&#8217;t be amazingly successful in that endeavor. We caught up at the beginning of the conference and talked about his recent decision to leave Target. It turns out that all the scary things that you would think about leaving a job just go away when you begin to understand Bobby&#8217;s motivations for leaving. He&#8217;s so easy to talk to and get along with that it&#8217;s a privilege to count him as a friend, and it was awesome to get to hang out with him nearly every day during the conference.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also got to hang out with fellow-OPIer, Colin Harrington. On the second day of the conference, Colin and I sat in the speaker&#8217;s lounge and talked about everything from testing to devops, and all topics in between. I am proud to have given Colin the idea for the "Fifty Shades of Testing" slide that got his presentation so much attention. If you ever get to hear Colin compare software development to The Lord of the Rings, you&#8217;ll realize that he had an innate ability to take the most complicated concepts and put them into a perspective that is easily consumed. I wish that he and I could have spent more time hanging out during the conference, but we managed to meet up nearly every day, so I guess for two really busy speakers that&#8217;s pretty good.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also wish that I could have spent more time hanging out with Peter Ledbrook. During Gr8Conf US, Peter and I had the chance to hang out quite a bit, and I was hoping for the same during SpringOne, but alas we were both speaking multiple times, so our schedules didn&#8217;t align as much as I would&#8217;ve liked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I did get the opportunity to have quite a few conversations with Graeme Rocher. We caught up the day before the conference started and talked everything from Grails to unemployment rates in Spain. Getting to know Graeme is really cool because he has such an interesting life story and unique perspective on most subjects. He&#8217;s also amazingly smooth at context switching between subjects and skill levels, and is one of the only people I know who keeps his composure so fluid when somebody says something stupid to him. During the second night reception, I was interviewing him for InfoQ when one of the "socially mis-calibrated" conference attendees interrupted us and berated Graeme with questions and comments in the ballpark of "Why does nobody use Grails?" and "Everybody I work with prefers Node.js because it doesn&#8217;t suck". I think Graeme is able to see through comments and questions like that, and maintains his posture in such an eloquent way as he responds in a very thoughtful and receptive way. I found that I was getting more upset at the guy than he was, and afterwards I realized that there&#8217;s probably a lesson that I can learn from Graeme through his behavior. It was great to get to know him better, and I look forward to future conversations with him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Throughout the conference, I also got to spend time talking to Søren Berg Glasius, who is the organizer of Gr8Conf EU. We met up for dinner on the Saturday before the conference, and found many more times to talk and share experiences. He also introduced me to two of his colleagues, Niels and Morton, with whom I also had excellent conversations throughout the conference. These guys flew some 9+ hours to get to the conference, so I was privileged that I could welcome them and meet them upon their arrival. Søren gave me perhaps the most candid feedback after my first talk when he said, "Well, I didn&#8217;t fall asleep, so that means it was pretty good". Because of his role in organizing Gr8Conf EU, Søren has great relationships with many of the speakers, and knows nearly everybody in the Groovy and Grails community. It was exciting when he announced that he would be spending a year in California starting next year, and I look forward to trying to find time to catch up with him once he&#8217;s here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many, many more people who I enjoyed talking to and spend time with, including <a href="http://twitter.com/ryanvanderwerf">Ryan Vanderwerf</a>, his coworker Rob, <a href="http://twitter.com/ben_t_mcguire">Ben McGuire</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/nebhale">Ben Hale</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/jeffscottbrown">Jeff Brown</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/burtbeckwith">Exalted Professor Burt Beckwith</a>, just to name a few. After Gr8Conf in July, I promised Burt that next time we met I would bring him Republican National Convention stickers and pins, but I ultimately dropped the ball. Next time, dear professor, next time&#8230;</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_fun">The Fun</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the Sunday night before the conference, after everybody had arrived and gotten settled, a bunch of us met in the lobby/bar/lounge area for drinks and conversation. At the peak of the night, we had a grouping of probably about a dozen people, who were all bullshitting and having a real blast. As the bar approached closing, Tomas brought in a bottle of scotch and a bottle of whiskey (I think that&#8217;s what they were). We, of course, couldn&#8217;t drink it at the bar, but the waitress graciously informed us that nobody would bother us if we were drinking by the pool.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The weaklings went up to bed, but a couple of us&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;including myself, Juan Reyes, Jeff Brown, Tomas, Ryan Vanderwerf, his coworker Rob, and &#8230; probably some other people&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;made it out to the pool for heavy drinking and bullshitting. We were fortunate that Jeff Brown was there because we all wanted to talk Grails, and after some non-zero number of shots, I was misquoted as stating that I hate plugins. Maybe I said it, maybe I didn&#8217;t; the truth lies somewhere at the bottom of an empty hotel drinking glass, and we&#8217;ll probably never know. But what I do remember is that by about 1:30a, I had to call it quits. The rest of the group kept going for what was reported as anywhere from a half an hour to four days. Suffice it to say, we had a blast getting to know each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think that everybody had loosened up a lot by Wednesday night; I know that I certainly had. I was excited that my talks were finished and that my second one went as smoothly as it did, so I was ready to let loose. I had also promised Colin and Bobby at least one night of debauchery and heavy drinking during the conference, so Wednesday night seemed most appropriate. At some point early in the evening, Ryan supplied a bottle of bourbon that didn&#8217;t stand a chance for that particular occasion. Juan had also taken the pre-emptive measure of going to a not-so-nearby liquor store to get a bottle of Tequila, and as a small group we again made our way out to a table by the pool. Peter and Stephane showed up, and although Peter promised himself only a small sip of spirits, I think it was he and I who did the most damage to Juan&#8217;s bottle of Tequila.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was privileged that after I&#8217;d had enough booze to tranquilize a fully-staffed submarine, I was able to demonstrate my finest British accent for Peter. He was quick with criticism, but I knew that deep-down he really liked it, and recognized my power over linguistics as worthy for the masses. Some day, when I&#8217;m a rich and famous actor in British films, I&#8217;ll remind Peter that he was a big part of me getting there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The weather was so amazing that night that it seemed only logical that we go for a swim and a jacuzzi dip. Colin, Stephane, and I were the only ones who thought it was a good idea, but we had a blast swimming and drinking, and talking Pivotal and Project Reactor amongst other things. Stephane is a super cool guy, and it was really great to get to know him in real life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At some point in the night, that is now little more than vague memories, somebody brought out a projector and played Pootie Tang onto the side of hotel, which was maybe the coolest thing that I&#8217;d ever seen. I&#8217;m sure that I didn&#8217;t last much longer than that, but the next morning, to the surprise of my uninitiated follow conference goers, I managed to make it to breakfast by 7:30a.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For me, this is what the conference was all about. It was great to get to see all the presentations and learn about the new technologies, but actually getting to personally know the people behind those technologies is the biggest reward of them all. I&#8217;m happy that I can count so many of these brilliant people as my friends, and that we had the time during the conference to bond and get to know each other better. That&#8217;s the stuff that really matters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over all, I think we all had a really badass time; I already can&#8217;t wait for SpringOne 2GX 2014!</p>
