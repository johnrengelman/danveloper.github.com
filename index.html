	  <h4>Introduction</h4>
	  <p>
A little while ago I heard about a project that wired up real time logging using comet or something similar, maybe long-polling ajax and updated a contained view. From an operations standpoint, rapid access to streaming logs like that is the pen-ultimate insight. Most will spawn hundreds of terminals, ssh'ing furiously between boxes, tailing logs in tiled view on one screen, fullscreen on another, cascaded on another. If you do this every day, you've undoubtedly learned the zen of having that insight, but have also probably learned the amount of headaches that go along with this approach. I've always wanted to have a consolidated view of streaming logs from my apps, and even though there's a lot of ways to do this, there's nothing that's truly "awesome" at doing it... In fact, I'd go as far to say that most of them really suck. To that end, I set off to write my own -- something awesome, designed for modern users, that leverages the extent of what we can do with technology, instead of limiting to the lowest common denominator.
<br/><br/>
In as concise a manner as possible, I'm intent to have this post serve as a technical write-up on how I leveraged a modern technology stack to be able to monitor my Java/Log4j application logs in real time. I have a tendency to get carried away when I'm talking about really awesome stuff, so I'll do my best to focus on the how-to without sacrificing technical detail.

	  <h4>Orientation</h4>
	  <p>
Allow me to orient you on what I'm hoping to accomplish. When an application in my domain writes a log message, I want that message sent to my logging server and delivered at the same time to everybody who is viewing the real-time logging web page. Since this is the future, I expect that there won't be a delay in getting the message to everybody at the same time. In other words, all clients should receive log messages at the same time (so no polling).

      <div class="row-fluid marketing body">
	<div class="span12">
	  <h4>Tech Stack</h4>
	  <p>
I built the server application and tech stack using a reactive, message-driven programming paradigm. Every operation that happens &mdash; from the logging event to the client's DOM being updated &mdash; is initiated by a log message being delivered to the server. There's no polling that happens, which also means that everything happens in real-time. Let me talk about the frameworks and technologies that I used to get there:
<ul>

 <li><b>Grails</b> - The server is built on Grails, which gives us Spring right out the box, and we will use that to make this all possible.</li>
 <li><b>ActiveMQ</b> - An ActiveMQ JMS server is embedded in the Grails application, allowing client applications to send their logging messages to the server as a JMS message.</li>
 <li><b>Spring Integration</b> - Spring Integration is used to bridge the receipt of the JMS message to a service class that decorates the message and ultimately uses Atmosphere to broadcast it to the web page.</li>
 <li><b>Atmosphere</b> - Atmosphere is used to publish updates to clients via Websockets, and there was already a grails plugin made to do this, so it was an easy choice.</li>
 <li><b>Jetty</b> - Websocket support is a must and Tomcat sucks at them, so I went with Jetty.</li>
 <li><b>Log4j</b> - Log4j is what everything already uses for logging and has a JMS appender out of the box, so it was an easy choice. The JMS appender was extended for the purposes of this application -- more on that next.</li>

</ul>

(... Not necessarily in that order.)

	  <h4>Enhancing Log4j's JMS Appender</h4>
	  <p>
I should probably start at the lowest level here -- how we're going to get the message from the client application to the logging server. To do this, we need to enhance Log4j's out-of-the-box JMS appender. We'll be enriching the headers of the JMS message that would normally be delivered to include meta-data that will allow us to categorize the application (and define it as a unique logging instance). Essentially, we'll be adding properties that will uniquely define the message: the application's name, the hostname of the server the message came from, and the ip address they came from. I figured this provided a pretty solid composite key to uniquely differentiate the source of log messages. To accomplish this, we'll be overriding Log4j's <span class="code">JMSAppender#append</span> method.
<br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/danveloper/5208508.js"></script>
<br/>
Once the JMS appender is enhanced, we need to configure Log4j to use it. We'll need to change some properties from the <a href="http://activemq.apache.org/how-do-i-use-log4j-jms-appender-with-activemq.html" target="_blank">default implementation</a> - to tell the appender what our application name is:
<br/><br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/danveloper/5208518.js"></script>
<br/>
This configuration will write log messages via both stdout and our enhanced JMS appender. The enriched headers will tell the server what channel the log file is to written to for our clients. That way we'll be able to watch many log files in a single page view. #awesome
<br/><br/>
The code for this is inside the <a href="https://github.com/danveloper/real-time-logging/tree/master/enhanced-log4j-jms-appender" target="_blank">enhanced-log4j-jms-appender directory</a> of the project. If you follow the simple path, from that directory you can run <span class="code">./gradlew install</span> and it will install the artifact to your local maven repository. From there, you can resolve the artifact in your client applications (the applications for which you would like to see the logs) with:

	  <h4>Embedding the ActiveMQ Server</h4>
	  <p>
Probably one of the most important things that I was trying to accomplish was making this project entirely self-contained. To that end, I decided to embed an ActiveMQ JMS server inside the Grails application, so that logging applications could log directly to my application's instance. Of course, there's no reason why you couldn't point to a centralized JMS server. On a side note, having an embedded JMS server inside a Grails application turns out to be a really cool thing, and the flexibility of Spring Integration with AMQ channels means that you can make some really cool message-driven stuff based off of this.
<br/><br/>
To start with, define the dependencies in <span class="code">BuildConfig.groovy</span>:
<br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/danveloper/5208543.js"></script>
<br/>
Now we can use the AMQ Spring context-integration to integrate AMQ seamlessly into our Grails app. To do this, add the following to <span class="code">resources.groovy</span>:
<br/><br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/danveloper/5208548.js"></script>
<br/>
Now you have AMQ fully integrated in the Spring context. When the Grails app starts up, it will also stand-up a JMS server on port <span class="code">61616</span>. We've also created a bean called <span class="code">logMessageDestination</span> that will serve as the destination object for messages sent to <span class="code">log.*</span> topics on the JMS server.

	  <div class="span12">
	    <h4>Becoming Message Driven</h4>
	    <p>
An important part of the goal of the project is to show the log message in a web view as soon as the logging event occurs. If we handle retrieving/processing log messages by polling the queue, there's a chance that the people who are waiting to see the log messages will not get them as soon as possible, so this isn't a good thing. To solve this, what we want to do is kick off a sequence of events that will ultimately broadcast the message simultaneously to everybody who's waiting to see it. To do this we can leverage the strength of Spring Integration to build a message-driven workflow.
<br/><br/>
Begin by defining the Spring Integration dependencies in <span class="code">BuildConfig.groovy</span>:
<br/><br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/danveloper/5208555.js"></script>
<br/>
Now we need to extend our Spring context to tell it to do stuff when a message is received on the ActiveMQ JMS channel. To do this, we'll use the Spring Integration 'jms' namespace to configure a jms channel adapter that will internally transfer the message from the JMS channel to an internal channel that we'll also define in the configuration.
<br/><br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/danveloper/5208564.js"></script>
<br/>
We've done a few things here, including registering the <span class="code"><a href="https://github.com/danveloper/real-time-logging/blob/master/log-server/src/groovy/com/danveloper/realtimelogging/server/services/LoggingServiceActivator.groovy" target="_blank">LoggingServiceActivator</a></span> class in the Spring context as a bean named <span class="code">logServiceActivator</span>. From there, we're also defining a Spring Integration channel named <span class="code">logChannel</span>, and attaching a chain to that channel so that every message that goes to it will be delegated to the <span class="code">log</span> method of the <span class="code">logServiceActivator</span> instance. (I do operations against channels in chains because it's really easy to add things on to them later without having to think too hard about it.) The final (and most important) thing in this configuration is attaching the <span class="code">logMessageDestination</span> destination to the <span class="code">logChannel</span> Spring Integration channel using Spring Integration's JMS <span class="code"><a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-integration/archive/1.0.0.RELEASE/reference/html/ch17s02.html" target="_blank">message-driven-channel-adapter</a></span>. Using this configuration, messages that are delivered to the <span class="code">log.*</span> topic will now be delegated to the <span class="code"><a href="https://github.com/danveloper/real-time-logging/blob/master/log-server/src/groovy/com/danveloper/realtimelogging/server/services/LoggingServiceActivator.groovy#L19" target="_blank">log</a></span> method of the <span class="code"><a href="https://github.com/danveloper/real-time-logging/blob/master/log-server/src/groovy/com/danveloper/realtimelogging/server/services/LoggingServiceActivator.groovy" target="_blank">LoggingServiceActivator</a></span> class. Now we can do some really cool stuff...

      <div class="row-fluid marketing body">
	<div class="span12">
	  <h4>Making the Message Usable</h4>
	  <p>
Now that we have the message going to a service class, we can massage it before broadcasting it to the web page. Before we can do that, though, we need to read the message meta-data off of the headers that were enriched with the <span class="code"><a href="https://github.com/danveloper/real-time-logging/blob/master/enhanced-log4j-jms-appender/src/main/java/com/danveloper/log4j/jms/EnhancedJMSAppender.java" target="_blank">EnhancedJMSAppender</a></span>. Using this data, we can construct a command object that we'll send to another service that will use Atmosphere and Websockets to deliver it to the right channel for the UI to update the web page.
<br/><br/>
The <span class="code"><a href="https://github.com/danveloper/real-time-logging/blob/master/log-server/src/groovy/com/danveloper/realtimelogging/server/services/LoggingServiceActivator.groovy" target="_blank">LoggingServiceActivator</a></span> is really simple, and really serves as just a transformer from the message payload structure to a command object type that the <span class="code"><a href="https://github.com/danveloper/real-time-logging/blob/master/log-server/grails-app/services/com/danveloper/realtimelogging/server/services/LoggingService.groovy" target="_blank">LoggingService</a></span> is expecting:
<br/><br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/danveloper/5208581.js"></script>
<br/>
The <span class="code">LogMessageCommand</span> object also decorates the properties of the message with a <span class="code">messageTime</span> property, indicating when the message was received. In my example this property is unused, however it could be used to determine if a logging channel (widget) in the UI is valid anymore (and possibly remove it if not).

	<div class="span12">
	  <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
	  <p>
The <a href="http://grails.org/plugins/atmosphere" target="_blank">Atmosphere plugin for Grails</a> removes a lot of the set-up and makes it really easy to stand-up a Websocket end-point with very little effort. After installing the plugin, I defined the mapping URI in the Grails config file.
<br/><br/>
In <span class="code">Config.groovy</span>:
<br/><br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/danveloper/5208588.js"></script>
<br/>
The composed URL from this path will become the endpoint for the user interface's websocket connector. When new logging messages come in, we'll broadcast them through this endpoint and the javascript code will figure out what needs to happen with them.
<br/><br/>
With the mapping URI composed, we now have to indicate that we want to use it... The default behavior in the grails-atmosphere-plugin is to map all paths under the <span class="code">'/atmosphere'</span> URI to the Stratosphere servlet, which is the under-the-covers class that Atmosphere uses to communicate through websockets (in our case) back to the user interface. As you can see from the above code snippet, this behavior was just fine for my purposes, but if you have other needs, you can configure this value in <span class="code"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/danveloper/real-time-logging/blob/master/log-server/grails-app/conf/AtmosphereConfig.groovy">grails-app/conf/AtmosphereConfig.groovy</a></span>.  You may recall from the above that messages are delegated to the <span class="code">log</span> method on the <span class="code">LoggingService</span>. The below code snippet demonstrates what happens with those messages once they are received. Notice that using the grails-atmosphere-plugin, the <span class="code">broadcaster</span> map is conveniently injected into our service. This map contains the URI to broadcaster relationship, so we can use it to get a handle on the mapping URI's broadcaster and publish messages to the UI.

      <div class="row-fluid marketing body">
	<div class="span12">
	  <h4>User Interface</h4>
	  <p>
Now that we're receiving, transforming, and transmitting the log messages via Websocket, we need to have the user interface listen for those messages and update the screen accordingly.
<br/><br/>
Inside the <span class="code">view/logging/index.gsp</span> file, I put the following:
<br/><br/>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/danveloper/5208601.js"></script>
<br/>
This instructs Atmosphere to call the <span class="code"><a href="https://github.com/danveloper/real-time-logging/blob/master/log-server/web-app/js/application.js#L3" target="_blank">Logging.router</a></span> function with an instance (sort of) of the message every time a broadcast is made to mapping URI. The "router" function on the Logging object tries to figure out if this is a message indicating that a new logger has joined the service, or if it's a message for a specific logging instance. If it's not a channel-specific logging message, it will delegate the message to a global callback function that will create a widget for the new loggers. If it's a message for a single application, it will figure out where that widget is and put the message into its container.

	  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
	  <p>
The key takeaway that I hope you have from this project write-up is how you can leverage a modern tech stack to build some really creative and awesome things. Using Spring Integration to serve as the "skeleton" for your application lets you have a lot of flexibility in building really powerful message driven applications.
