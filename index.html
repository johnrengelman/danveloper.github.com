I recently left my nine-to-five after just seven months on the job. 
	  		</p>
			<p>
I took the job in the first place because their recruiting department had done such a stellar job of selling the culture of the company. They touted an organization of open-mindedness and collaboration; they showed off the Google-esque bean bags and the glass-enclosed "war rooms". This place, I had determined, was a place where I could learn a lot and do a lot of cool things. It seemed like mediocrity and closed-mindedness couldn't thrive in this environment -- certainly neither could bad management. But eventually, once the facade was unveiled, I was left with a sad reality, and a choice.
			</p>
<p>
My first two months on the job were spent familiarizing myself with, and improving, a particular application. At the end of the two months I had refactored over 40,000 lines of code to around 10,000 lines of code. We had a successful production release of the refactor and I was thrilled with my work, and the company. The guys that I worked with were great, and everything was living up to expectations. I bragged to my friends and former coworkers about how awesome my job was and how great things were going.
</p>
<p>
Then something weird happened. My boss was demoted and they called in a replacement. Since I didn't have any history with the company, I didn't have any idea what might have been the factors that led up to this point, but I did find it strange. It seemed like he was running a winning team. Our application stack was responsible for bringing in more tens of millions of dollars annually, and had done so under his guidance over the past five years.
</p>
<p>
The new guy was already a manager of another group, and at first he didn't say much. My old boss had been allowed to keep his office and was pretty much doing the same stuff, so I thought that it was just a paperwork thing, even though much ado at meetings was given to the official title changes. After a short period of time, my new boss decreed that he wanted to have weekly one-on-ones with everybody on the team. It was clear that this was his way of "getting to know the team" without having to actually *work* with the team, but I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt, so I withheld any judgement and I checked my biases at the door.
</p>
<p>
Quickly, the warning signs of bad management started to seep to the surface: red flags, ones for which I had become uniquely attuned, started to pop up. The signs were difficult to ignore, and I knew officially that we were in a bad management scenario when one of the senior developers on the team quit. 
</p>
<p>
I'm no stranger to bad management. At one company, I saw 32 senior level developers leave over a period of a few months because of the company's atrocious management. After the senior guys had all left that company, I stood by and watched as the remaining developers steadily trickled out. For a twenty month stretch of time, at least one developer had left every month because of mismanagement by the "Information Systems Leadership" group. I watched the company completely turn over a programming staff in just twenty-four months. It eventually got to the point where the good managers were also quitting.
</p>
<p>
The folks who had left that job were unconsciously aware of something that you only get with experience from working under bad management. They probably couldn't articulate it even now, but the reality was that those developers knew that once you've worked for bad management, you become more attuned to recognizing it. With this super power, the more experienced guys were able to make haste in their decisions before the consequences of bad management affected them.
</p>
<p>
Too much has been written on the consequences of bad management to an organization -- diminished morale, lower productivity, poor recruiting -- but that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about what those 32 senior level developers knew when they nearly-collectively walked out the door. They knew that they had three options: find a new job, get really embittered by the bad management, or learn to cope with the bad managers. Perhaps worse than any organization-wide impact of bad management is the toll that it can take on the individual developer when these decisions are what they're left with.
</p>
<p>
An employee's embitterment with a job ultimately results in them finding a new job, but the more experienced and senior guys would be able to tell you that bitterness isn't worth it. They would tell you to skip that step entirely and just go directly to finding a new job, because their experience has given them the benefit of being able to intuitively recognize when decisions need to be made. They also know that when the options are reduced to finding a new job or learning to cope with the bad management, the latter will only hurt your career. That's a fact that my latest encounter with bad management has allowed me to see with an unparalleled lucidity.
</p>
<p>
The reality, though, is that for some people it makes sense to develop those coping strategies. Not everybody goes to a job to build a career, and not everybody stays in a position because they like the work and love the company. For some people it makes sense for financial or family reasons to learn to deal with a crappy manager instead of trying to find a new job.
<p>
The downside to working with those guys is that they have made the decision to divert their focus from developing their craft and career, to developing coping strategies for their managers. Surrounding yourself with these people means that you will be susceptible to their rhythm of mediocrity. Certainly, when their time is split between developing themselves professionally and developing their ability to deal with the people they report to, they can hope to be little more than mediocre. Indeed, the people who survive exoduses of bad management are the ones who are mediocre craftsmen and competent copers.
<p>
Over the period of the next few months of working with my newly appointed manager, he had demonstrated all of the signs of bad management that my experience had shown me. Everybody recognizes and articulates them in different ways, so I won't go into what those signs are; what's more important is that you recognize the intuition that only experience can give you, and that you act on it when your spidey senses tingle.
<p>
When I recognized that the options were at hand, it was an easy decision for me to make. I was criticized hard by people in the company, by my peers, and my family. They said that I didn't give it enough time and that I wasn't patient enough. But what I knew is that some people will just never get to the point where they have developed that intuition or where they can recognize when it is warning them. It didn't matter though, because I knew that I had made the right choice. It was time to move on.
<p>
Ultimately, it will probably never make sense for me to develop coping strategies for a shitty manager. It might just be something about me or my personality, but maximizing my effort toward learning and growing personally, and professionally, is far more appealing to me than spending time and energy trying to learn to deal with some guy who's just bad at his job.
