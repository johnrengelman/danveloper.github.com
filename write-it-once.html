<p>I really hate the argument that a "system" is defined by its limitations. In a broad context, it of course makes sense, but in terms of application development, using that as a crutch to say that we cannot implement a feature because we didn&#8217;t define the limitations of the application to be flexible enough, or with wide enough of a context in mind from the design phase, is a really irresponsible approach to "architecture"&#8230; It probably doesn&#8217;t even qualify as architecture at that point.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I always try to find ways to structure my applications in a way that will be amenable to out-of-scope and evolving requirements. Especially since most projects are agile now and we don&#8217;t have that bulky six-to-eighteen-month period of requirements gathering where the boundaries and scope of the application are defined, and if a stakeholder didn&#8217;t get their thoughts in during that time then shame on them!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We want to be flexible, and lean, and agile, and scrum in our project management, but I think the reality is that we, as application developers, are still struggling to get there when we&#8217;re writing code. How many times have you heard another developer complain about incoming requirements, or feature requests for a project, that have nothing to do with the scope of the application that they already started building. So, think about it this way: as developers, we want the flexibility to be able to implement the application as we see fit, and to discover the best ways to approach a problem without the rigidity of Business Requirements Documents, but we don&#8217;t want to give the business community the same flexibility to discover the requirements of the application as its being developed?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That seems a little one-sided on our part, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, if we take a step back and think about the application in terms of the lifecycle of the data that the code is going to be working with, we can start to build a skeleton around the phases that apply to the processing lifecycle. Think about, from a high level, a contrived example of a banking system, and consider the lifecycle of a request to withdraw funds from a given account…</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The different phases for this request might break down into something like:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

<ul>
<li>
<p>Request Authorization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fund validation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fund withdrawal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fund delivery</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can think of these phases as the fundamental points of execution for this fund withdrawal workflow. And, if we think about it like that, then we can take the minutia that applies to the discrete components of this workflow, and build them as functional, modularized business objects that can easily handle and adapt to evolving requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To be less abstract with that mode of thinking, consider the "Fund withdrawal" phase of the "Withdrawal Workflow", and think that, from a business standpoint, when the balance of the account reduces, the system may need to adjust the rate for which that account accrues interest, or apply penalties based on some business logic that is yet-to-be-defined. If we start by developing the application in a way that allows us to implement those business requirements in a modularized fashion, then we can be more agile with the business community as they are discovering and fine-tuning those specific requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we can begin at a high level by breaking the application down into the lifecycle of the data, then we can make use of messaging patterns to tie those individual "modules" together to build a comprehensive system that is flexible and adaptable. For this to be practical, the messaging layer will need to be centralized and easy to maintain, otherwise we may end up sacrificing the "rapid" part of "rapid application development" that we need so much.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Luckily, we can have our cake and eat it too…</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-integration" target="_blank">Spring Integration</a> gives us not only an excellent abstraction for the complexities of messaging in Java, but also a facility to manage the phases of the data lifecycle in a centralized way, through non-programmatic configuration. It also happens to integrate seamlessly with Grails, because it builds on Spring, on which Grails is based. To that end, we get the benefits of adaptability to mutating requirements and the rapid application development gains from choosing Grails as our web development framework.</p>
