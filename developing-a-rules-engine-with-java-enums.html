	  <h4>Foreword Thoughts...</h4>
	  <p>
		I worry a lot when I write code. Seriously, I do. I'm a little neurotic during the process of implementing new code, because I want to make sure that the code leaves a good impression of <i>me</i> and how I went about solving the problem that was at hand. I internalize a mantra, a passage from the introduction to <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin">Uncle Bob's</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a>: "<i>The next time you write a line of code, remember you are an author, writing for readers who will judge your effort</i>", and it guides my every keystroke. I <i>want</i> my code to be good; I want it to solve problems cleanly and effectively; I want it to be maintainble; I want it to be replaceable; I want it to be flexible; I want it to be easy to understand; but most importantly, I want it to leave a good impression of me, and how I went about solving the problem I was faced with.

	  <h4>Introduction</h4>
	  <p>
		If one thing is constant in application development, it is that every business and application rule is mutable and will change. There's a struggle when architecting a new application about what the most appropriate place, structurally, is to isolate the domain logic from the structure of the rest of the application. The underpinnings of any application are the transient components; it's the domain logic that needs to be wrapped inside a golden ticket and segemented off some place safe for future generations to maintain. Nobody from the business community ever came down to a developer and asked them to change the name of their JMS topic channels (at least not with good reason). More appropriately, a representative from the business community might come to a developer and ask them to implement a feature that will send an email to a customer after their first online order. Or even better, this same representative might say that they've been having problems with customers filling out their shipping address during checkout in the online store, so they want to default the shipping address to the credit card's billing address <i>if</i> &mdash; and only <i>if</i> &mdash; they did not fill out the shipping address explicitly. Sending an email to a customer, defaulting the shipping address to the billing address &mdash; these are called business rules, or sometimes application rules, and they exist in an inherently mutable condition. Finding the most maintainable solution for implementing these rules is the struggle that we face as developers.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		I've spent a lot of time trying to crack this nut, and I've <a href="developing-a-rules-engine-in-groovy.html">blogged about one approach to doing this in Groovy.</a> Today, I want to share with you a way to use enumerations in Java to write a business rules engine that will keep the rules atmoic and isolated, while providing a structure that is flexible and adaptive as new rules come and old rules go.

	  <h4>Approach</h4>
	  <p>
		Recently, in my professional life, I've been spending a lot of time working on Java-based back-end development, so I've been using Java enums to solve a lot of problems. Enums are great in Java because they essentially provide singleton micro-instances that allow you to code atomic segments, while still keeping the overall idea of what you're writing structurally related through the enumeration. Additionally, we can get static access to each of the enumeration's instances by iterating over the result of the Enum.values() method. As I'll demonstrate, this means that we can build a categorically organized rules engine with flexible rules instances that can be swapped in and out without having to update static references or call chains. This ad-hoc way of getting code into and out of the rules engine is critical to producing clean code.

	  <h4>Scenario</h4>
	  <p>
		The scenario that I will use to demonstrate the Enum-based rules engine is an online store that has "decisions" that must be made about a product order prior to it being processed. These "decisions" are the rules of the application that we want to keep as maintainable and atomic as possible within the application structure.
	    <br/>
	    <dd>
		<h6>The Rules</h6>
	    	<ul>
	    		<li>As a user, I want to have my shipping address defaulted to my credit card's billing address unless I explicitly specify where I want my product shipped, so that I can have the best website experience possible.</li>
				<li>As a user, when I pay with a gift card, I want to be told that I must explicitly provide a shipping address, so that I can make sure that I can complete my order.</li>
				<li>As a marketing representative, I would like to provide product-type-specific coupons to users, so that we may generate revenue in specific verticals.</li>
				<li>As an accountant, I would like to make sure that we are applying 8% sales-tax to California-based orders, so that we are complying with state laws.</li>
				<li>As an accountant, I would like the shopping cart to use our Internal payment processor when a customer pays by gift card, and to use Stripe's (www.stripe.com) payment processor when they pay with a credit card, so that we can process payments as is appropriate.</li>
				<li>As an executive, I would like for every new customer who orders from us to receive a "welcome and thank you for your first order" email, so that we can drive a personal experience and customer loyalty.</li>
	    	</ul>
	    </dd>

	<div class="span12">
	  <h4>Model</h4>
	  <p>
		There is a bit of leg-work in building up the data model for processing the model, so to keep things simple, I have trimmed the objects to the properties that we really care about. The object graph will be structured something like:
		<br/>
		<dd>
		<h6>ProductOrder.java</h6>
		<p><i>This is the composition of the order and it is what the rules engine will process its rules against.</i></p>
			<ul>
				<li>hasOne "account"</li>
				<li>hasOne "shippingAddress"</li>
				<li>hasOne "paymentMethod"</li>
				<li>hasOne "taxRate"</li>
				<li>hasOne "paymentVendor"</li>
				<li>hasOne "firstOrderThankYou" (boolean)</li>
				<li>hasMany "products"</li>
				<li>hasMany "coupons"</li>
			</ul>
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/danveloper/4760232.js"></script>
	    <hr/>
		<h6>Account.java</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>hasOne "email"</li>
				<li>hasOne "orderCount"</li>
			</ul>
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/danveloper/4760240.js"></script>
		<hr/>
		<h6>Address.java</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>hasOne "street"</li>
				<li>hasOne "unit"</li>
				<li>hasOne "city"</li>
				<li>hasOne "state"</li>
				<li>hasOne "zip"</li>
			</ul>
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/danveloper/4760249.js"></script>
		<hr/>
		
		<h6>PaymentMethod.java, GiftCard.java, CreditCard.java</h6>
		<p><i>GiftCard</i></p>
			<ul>
				<li>hasOne "number"</li>
			</ul>
		<p><i>CreditCard</i></p>
			<ul>
				<li>hasOne "number"</li>
				<li>hasOne "expiration"</li>
				<li>hasOne "billingAddress"</li>
			</ul>
		<p><i>PaymentMethod</i></p>
			<ul>
				<li>all have one getType() method that defines what it is.</li>
			</ul>
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/danveloper/4760263.js"></script>
		<hr/>

		<h6>Product.java</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>hasOne "name"</li>
				<li>hasOne "type"</li>
				<li>hasOne "cost"</li>
			</ul>
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/danveloper/4760276.js"></script>
		<hr/>

		<h6>Coupon.java</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>hasOne "id"</li>
				<li>hasOne "discountRate"</li>
				<li>hasMany "appliesTo" (the product types that this coupon is allowed to apply to)</li>
			</ul>
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/danveloper/4760281.js"></script>
		<hr/>

	    <p>So this is the composition of our model. As I stated, the <a href="https://gist.github.com/danveloper/4760232">ProductOrder.java</a> class is what ties it all together, and is how the rules will be processed.</p>

	    <h4>Rules Engine Interface</h4>
	    <p>
			A little gem with Java enums is that if your enum implements an interface, each of the instance values will have to implement the interface as well. This is a great way to develop atomic, micro-instances that conform to a common contract. For the purposes of this post's example, I have a <a href="https://gist.github.com/danveloper/4760298">ProductOrderRulesEngine</a> interface that defines the contract for each of our individual rules. It is simple, with only a single method to enact apply the rule. The return type of the rule method is a boolean, because we may have a rule that has go/no-go behavior (the shipping address is null, and the user is paying with a gift card, for example).

	<div class="span12">
	  <h4>Rules Engine</h4>
	  <p>
		The best way to understand the enum-based rules engine is simply to look at it an walk through the code. As you code, recall our rules as they were defined above:
	    	<ul>
	    		<li>As a user, I want to have my shipping address defaulted to my credit card's billing address unless I explicitly specify where I want my product shipped, so that I can have the best website experience possible.</li>
				<li>As a user, when I pay with a gift card, I want to be told that I must explicitly provide a shipping address, so that I can make sure that I can complete my order.</li>
				<li>As a marketing representative, I would like to provide product-type-specific coupons to users, so that we may generate revenue in specific verticals.</li>
				<li>As an accountant, I would like to make sure that we are applying 8% sales-tax to California-based orders, so that we are complying with state laws.</li>
				<li>As an accountant, I would like the shopping cart to use our Internal payment processor when a customer pays by gift card, and to use Stripe's (www.stripe.com) payment processor when they pay with a credit card, so that we can process payments as is appropriate.</li>
				<li>As an executive, I would like for every new customer who orders from us to receive a "welcome and thank you for your first order" email, so that we can drive a personal experience and customer loyalty.</li>

	  <h4>Testing the engine</h4>
	  <p>
		I use Groovy to test these things, because it is very easy to write procedural code that is easy to follow. An example of a test script that validates the behavior of the rules engine looks something like this:
