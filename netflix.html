<p>I&#8217;m honored and privileged to announce today that I have accepted a position with <a target="_blank" href="http://netflix.com">Netflix</a> to join the Cloud Infrastructure Tools team! I&#8217;m looking forward to the opportunity to learn and grow with some of the most talented people in the industry, as well to have my own impression on the technology that brings entertainment to so many people across the globe. It&#8217;ll truly be an excellent experience, and I am very excited to be joining the team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reality is that it was somewhat of a difficult decision to make. I&#8217;ve worked at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.objectpartners.com">Object Partners</a> now for about 8 months, and that time has really flown by. I honestly had no interest in finding another job, but when I started to talk to the team&#8217;s manager, <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/aglover">Andy Glover</a>, I was very impressed with the company and the opportunity. Even when I agreed to visit the Netflix HQ for an on-site interview, I still wasn&#8217;t convinced that this would be the move that I would make. Getting to meet the team and hang out with the geniuses that I&#8217;ll be working with swayed my decision greatly; though truthfully, right up until about 12 hours ago when I signed the paperwork, I was still on the edge of deciding whether or not I was prepared to leave OPI. Ultimately, I know that I made the decision that was right for me&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;I want to be a part of something big, and to learn and understand the matters of scale that Netflix deals with as their day-to-day business, while getting to work with a bunch of super nice&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and super smart&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;folks in the process. It also didn&#8217;t hurt that they craft their job offers in a way that makes them unrefusable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That I even had to consider my options is a total testiment to the work that Object Partners is doing in this field. To date, they are hands-down the greatest company that I have worked for, and I would unconditionally recommend them to anybody who is interested in this line of work. Object Partners also has a world-class talent pool, and I will miss working with and learning from brilliant people like <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/rllyon">Randy Llyon</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/colinharrington">Colin Harrington</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/johnrengelman">John Engleman</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/opiamiller">Andy Miller</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/lightsabersd">Doug Sabers</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/staticnull">Eric Kinsella</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/jondejong">Jon DeJong</a>, to name a few. This is truly a sample of the greatest technical minds that I have ever met, and some of the nicest people too. On the business side, <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/ehrenseim">Ehren Seim</a> is the greatest person who could be at the helm of a company. I struggled a lot when I told him that I was planning to leave; besides being my boss, I consider Ehren a good friend, and even though we&#8217;ve only known each other for a short time, it&#8217;s hard to think about not having him on my team. I hope that as time goes on, I can continue to refer great clients to OPI, because this is a business that deserves its continued success.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to the coming year, and the work that I&#8217;ll be doing with Netflix. I expect that I&#8217;ll have the opportunity to continue my work with Ratpack, which will give me an idea of real-world problems that the framework can solve. I&#8217;m thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work in Open Source, and to help simplify the evolving world of "cloud" for others who are emerging into this problem domain. I know the team is deeply committed to giving back to the community, and in that I hope to offer as much as I possibly can.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ll continue my work as an Editor for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.infoq.com">InfoQ</a>, and as well to write blog posts on subjects ranging from System Administration to Web Development. I also plan to present at conferences this Summer, and I have submitted abstracts for variations on my <em>Groovy for System Administrators</em> talk, as well as presentations about <a target="_blank" href="http://ratpack.io">Ratpack</a>, and general enterprise architecture. I&#8217;m really excited about these presentations, because I believe that they touch on solving the problems that most developers will face with their projects. I hope that they are accepted.</p>
